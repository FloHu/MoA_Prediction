Each of the three gamma/tau subunits (P06710) can bind one molecule of ATP but the binding of a single molecule of ATP per complex is sufficient. Binding of ATP opens the pentameric ring of DnaX (see below) and allows interaction with the open beta subunit sliding clamp (CPX-1927). Subsequent attachment of the template-primer DNA to the pentameric ring triggers hydrolysis and detachment of the DnaX complex from the beta clamp-DNA complex (CPX-1927). The beta clamp closes and facilitates strand elongation via the DNA polymerase III core subcomplex (CPX-1925).	The DnaX complex consists of seven subunits. The pentameric ring consisting of 3 tau/gamma subunits and one each of delta and delta'. These subunits interact with each other via their domains III. Domain III of subunit tau/gamma also interacts with subunit psi which binds to subunit chi. The stoichiometry for the tau/gamma subunits is not entirely certain: There are at least 2 and maybe up to 3 tau units in the pentameric ring with the gamma unit(s) attached to psi-chi complexes tethered to the SSB tetramer (CPX-1928). Domains I of the pentameric ring interact with the primer-template at the replication fork. Domain I of subunit delta also binds to the sliding clamp beta dimer (CPX-1927). Subunit tau binds to the C-terminal domain of subunit alpha (part of the polymerase subcomplex, CPX-1925) via its domain V and to the DnaB helicase (CPX-1946) via its domain IV.

SeqA forms filaments on methylated and hemimethylated DNA but has a higher avidity for hemimethylated GATC sites. Hemimethylated DNA is created during complementary strand synthesis before Dam protein fully methylates the new stand. Binding of SeqA to hemimethylated DNA sequesters the chromosomal replication origin, oriC, preventing re-methylation of DNA by Dam and in turn stopping premature re-initiation of replication during one replication cycle. Depletion of the SeqA pool towards the end of the replication cycle allows Dam protein to displace SeqA from the hemimethylated DNA, allowing it to fully methylate the DNA and initiate a new cycle of DNA replication. The SeqA-DNA complex travels with the replication folk sequentially binding to the majority of hemimethylated GATC sites of the newly-synthesized dsDNA. SeqA can form multimers consisting of dimers, tetramers octamers and higher order filaments but it is believed that the main form in vivo are filaments.	A filament made up of many SeqA molecules attached to GATC sites of dsDNA. The basic components of the filament may always be dimers rather than monomers.

The molybdopterin cofactor Mo-bisMGD receives electrons from formate, passes them down a Fe-S cluster chain to the periplasmic heme, from there to the cytoplasmic heme from where it is transferred to quinone on FdnH. Quinol transports the electrons to the NarGHI complex. The collaboration of these two complexes contributes to the proton motive force: electrons are ultimately donated to Fdh-N by formate in the periplasm, transported to the cytoplasm and accepted by nitrate. Hydrogen ions are transported in the opposite direction: Quinone is reduced to quinol by cytoplasmic protons which are in turn released into the periplasm when quinol is oxidized to quinone.	Trimeric trimer. MW ~ 510 kD (trimer). Fdh-N is composed of a Mo-bisMGD-containing catalytic subunit FdnG, a Fe-S cluster-containing electron transfer subunit FdnH and a heme-containing cytochrome b556 subunit FdnI. Formate binds to the FdnG-bound Mo-bisMGD cofactor and quinone to the FdnG subunit.

First, TRCF relieves transcription-dependent NER inhibition due to occlusion of the DNA lesion by RNAP. TRCF approaches the stalled RNAP from behind and induces its forward translocation and subsequent release by stepping on dsDNA using ATP hydrolysis. The consequent collapse of the upstream end of the transcription bubble leads to a massive destabilization of the otherwise stable ternary elongation complex, consisting of the open DNA transcription fork and the newly-synthesised RNA, and transcription termination. Second, TRCF recruits the UvrABC repair system (CPX-2151, CPX-2152, CPX-2153) to the unmasked lesion by binding to UvrA, a subunit of the UvrAB complex (CPX-2151). UvrA binding to TRCF and UvrB are probably mutually exclusive owing to the conserved interface on UvrA. Formation of the TRCF-UvrA complex initiates a cascade of events resulting in lesion excision and gap filling. TRCF also has roles beyond TCR - in the rescue of replication forks stalled by head-on collisions with RNAPs, in the development of antibiotic resistance, recombination, and transcriptional regulation.	-	Heterodimer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

The fimbria consists of a 1-2 um long fimbrial rod, built by thousands of copies of the non-adhesive major subunit, FimA (P04128). The tip is optimized to have a dual functionality: flexible exploration and force sensing. The FimFGH subunits interact through donor strand complementation where a beta-strand from one subunit completes the beta-sandwich structure of the neighboring subunit. FimH contains a lectin domain which binds mannose derivatives on the surface of neighboring cells. 	The mannose-binding lectin domain of the apex-positioned adhesive protein FimH is docked to the anchoring pilin domain in a distinct hook. The hooked conformation is highly stable under no force conditions but allows an easy separation of the domains upon application of force, allowing the lectin domain to switch from a low- to a high-affinity state. The conformation between the FimH pilin domain and the adjacent FimG subunit of the tip is open and stable even when force is applied, providing an extended lever arm for the hook unhinging under shear. The conformation between FimG and FimF subunits is highly flexible even in the absence of force, allowing lateral and rotational flexibility to efficiently explore target surfaces. An additional molecule, FimC (P31697) co-crysallises and co-purifies with this complex but is a chaperone molecule which provides a surrogate donor strand before delivery of each subunit to the growing fimbria.

Repair is initiated by the binding of MutS to a mismatch or to a small insertion-deletion loop. 	MutS binds DNA in a homodimeric form. After mismatch recognition, MutS exchanges ADP for ATP and undergoes a conformational change to form a sliding clamp on DNA. By interactions via C-terminal domains, the MutS dimers can form tetramers. Tetrameric MutS has a slow dissociation from DNA, which can be due to occasional bending over and binding DNA in its two binding sites. In contrast, the dimer dissociation is faster, primarily dependent on a combination of the type of mismatch and the flanking sequence.	Homodimer, Homotetramer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence and are composed of a toxin, which causes growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, and a cognate antitoxin, which neutralizes the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded, leaving the toxins to exert their toxic effects, leading to growth arrest and dormancy. Type II TA complexes are small protein-protein pairs; under growth conditions, the toxin is bound to the antitoxin, which inhibits its activity. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription. Under stress conditions, cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176) are activated that preferentially cleave the antitoxins, freeing the toxins to inhibit growth by inhibiting translation or replication, enabling cells to enter a metabolically dormant state until the stress is removed. Complex formation prevents the protein kinase HipA acting as a persistence factor, inducing multi-drug tolerance by triggering growth arrest. HipA activity is inhibited upon binding to HipB through sequestration to the nucleoid and binding to DNA. HipB and HipAB act as a transcriptional autoregulators of the hipBA operon. 	In the HipA-HipB-DNA complex, the HipB dimer is sandwiched on each side by one HipA molecule and the complex is formed from noncontiguous regions of both HipA and HipB.

The system memorizes previous infections by integrating short sequences of invading genomes (spacers) into the CRISPR locus. The spacers, interspaced with repeats, are expressed as small guide CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are employed by Cas proteins to target invaders sequence-specifically upon a reoccurring infection. Upon viral invasion, the Cascade complex binds double-stranded DNA exhibiting sequence complementary to the crRNA spacer sequence, while displacing the non-target strand to form an R-loop, and then recruits the nuclease Cas3/ygcB (P38036) for target degradation. 	The complex exhibits a sea-horse-shaped architecture, the 11 subunits are assembled into two structural layers. Six casC proteins, together with casD and casE, tightly pack to form the outer layer, the casC helical stack forming a groove in which the crRNA lies.

The flagellar motor of bacteria is a rotary device energized by the membrane ion gradient and the complex is required for the rotation and directional switching of the flagellum and also functions in flagellar assembly. Motor torque is produced at the top of the switch complex, where the fliG C-terminal domain bears several conserved charged residues that interact with charged groups of the stator protein motA (P09348). The conformation of this complex is such that the flagellum rotates in a clockwise (CW) direction, induced by binding of cheY-P to the lower part of the C-ring. cheY-P interacts initially with the N-terminal segment of fliM, which is flexible enough to allow subsequent binding to a site on fliN. Coupled conformational transitions in fliM trigger large displacements of a distant alpha-helix in fliG, involved in stator contacts, inducing the change of the flagellar rotors from counterclocwise (smooth-swimming phenotype) to clockwise rotation (tumbly phenotype). 	Formed from about 26 copies of fliG, 34 copies of fliM, and more than 100 copies of fliN. The lower part of the switch complex is formed from fliN, organized in doughnut-shaped tetramers that alternate with the fliM C-terminal domains in an array at the membrane distal region of a large drum-shaped feature of approximately 40nM, at the bottom of the basal body - the C-ring. The thinner side-wall of the C-ring, above the fliN/fliM C-terminal array, is formed from the fliM middle domain. fliG is proximal to the membrane and its middle domain interacts with fliM. Phosphoryl-cheY binds fliM with approximately 20-fold higher affinity than non-phosphorylated cheY. Binding measurements suggest that the switch binds many CheY-P molecules, and that several molecules must interact with the switch simultaneously to trigger direction reversal.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"-"(ceitec)

TBDTs are energy-dependent gated channels that usually transport large metal complexes which cannot fit through porins, and are too scarce to enter by mass-action-driven transport. Energy-dependent uptake through TBDTs requires interaction with TonB in complex with ExbB and ExbD in the inner membrane, ExbBD. TonB undergoes rapid energized movement driven by ExbBD which harvest the electrochemical force from the electrochemical proton gradient created by the proton gradient across the inner membrane and convert it into rotational motion. Hence, TonB may pull or twist the N-termini of TBDTs to promote transport of substrates into the periplasm. ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters subsequently move the cyanocobalamine through the periplasm and inner membrane.	The lumen of BtuB, a 22-stranded beta-barrel outer membrane protein, is blocked by an N-terminal plug domain preventing transit of vitamin B12. The binding of vitamin B12 induces an allosteric rearrangement of the plug domain, releasing a conserved motif, the Ton-box into the periplasmic space, where it forms a 1:1 complex. The transmembrane helix at the N-terminus of TonB forms a complex with ExbB and ExbD, which is necessary, together with an energized IM, for TonB-dependent transport.

A direct interaction between ParC of Topoisomerase IV (CPX-1104) and MukB leads to a fraction of TopoIV molecules being bound to MukBEF clusters Involved in chromosome condensation and segregation. MukB can stimulate the ability of topoisomerase IV to relax negatively supercoiled DNA. 	MukB consists of globular domains at the N- and C-termini connected by a long antiparallel coiled-coil (âˆ¼ 780 residues) folded at a hinge domain in the middle of the molecule. The bipartite N- and C-terminal domains together form an ATP-binding cassette-like ATPase domain (also called a head domain) at the distal end, whereas the hinge domain provides the dimerization interface, resulting in the characteristic V-shaped, two-armed dimeric structure. The two head domains are probably catalytically inactive, unless they engage each other to provide a critical catalytic residue opposing a ATP-binding site.

The active alpha(2)beta(2) complex has a compact structure that can be reversibly converted via a dynamic conformational rearrangement to an inactive alpha(4)beta(4) state in the presence of elevated deoxyATP. The homodimeric alpha-2 subunit contains the active site, where ribonucleotide reduction occurs, and two types of allosteric effector binding sites. One effector site tunes the specificity for all four ribonucleotide substrates in response to intracellular levels of deoxyribonucleoside 5â€²-triphosphates (dATP, dTTP, dGTP) and ATP. The second effector site controls the rate of reduction, binding ATP to turn the enzyme on or dATP to turn it off, thus reducing enzyme activity through a negative feedback mechanism.. The beta-2 subunit harbors the essential diferric-tyrosyl radical (Tyr-122) co-factor that initiates radical chemistry.

The system memorizes previous infections by integrating short sequences of invading genomes (spacers) into the CRISPR locus. The spacers, interspaced with repeats, are expressed as small guide CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are employed by Cas proteins to target invaders sequence-specifically upon a reoccurring infection. The Cas1-Cas 2 complex is essential for the incorporation of 33-bp long sequence-variable foreign DNA protospacers into the host CRISPR locus. CRISPR transcripts generated from the loci assemble with Cas proteins to detect and cleave foreign nucleic acids bearing sequence complementarity to the spacer segment. Cas1 is the probable nuclease that catalyzes the integration reaction, whilst Cas2 may provide a structural scaffold and stimulate the catalytic activity of Cas1 	The complex contains a pair of Cas1 dimers sandwiching one Cas2 dimer. Protospacer DNA binding triggers large structural rearrangements in Cas1-Cas2. The protospacer spans the central Cas2 dimer and terminates within individual Cas1 subunits on each end of the complex. Molecular weight 78.1kDa.	Heterohexamer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"-"(ceitec)
