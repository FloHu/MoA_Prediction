This is the code repository for my postdoc project at EMBL Heidelberg with the manuscript titled "Predicting drug mode of action using machine learning and chemical genetics reveals thiolutin as a cell wall damaging agent in Escherichia coli". This is currently under review by the PI. Please check the respective section on [my website](https://flohub.de/projects/) for further details.
